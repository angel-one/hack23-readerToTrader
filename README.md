# Stock Analysis AngelOne Chatbot with ChatGPT in Python

## Overview:
This Python-based chatbot uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to the stock market. It can answer queries about the current stock price of a particular stock, SMA, EMA, RSI and even generate the plots for stockâ€™s historical price data. We obtain live stock data using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance). It dynamically handles responses, invoking appropriate functions based on user queries and presenting the results in a user-friendly manner.
